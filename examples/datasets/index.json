It was designed to investigate the genomic underpinnings and prognostic implications of LVI in breast cancer. By comparing somatic and germline mutation profiles between LVI+ and LVI− subgroups, the study identified distinct molecular features in different clinical subtypes. LVI+ HR+/HER2− tumors exhibited elevated TP53 and ESR1 mutation rates, germline BRCA2 pathogenic variants, and clock-like SBS1 mutational signatures, while LVI+ HER2+ tumors were enriched for PIK3CA mutations and APOBEC-related SBS2 signatures. Moreover, the co-mutation of TP53 and NF1 was associated with poor prognosis in LVI+ HR+/HER2− patients.

Compared to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), this cohort exhibits a higher frequency of PIK3CA mutations and copy-number gains at chromosome 22q11. Through transcriptomic profiling, TNBCs were classified into four molecular subtypes: luminal androgen receptor (LAR), immunomodulatory, basal-like immune-suppressed, and mesenchymal-like. Each subtype was associated with distinct therapeutic targets or biomarkers. Notably, the LAR subtype demonstrated more frequent ERBB2 somatic mutations, loss of CDKN2A, and reduced prevalence of homologous recombination deficiency signature (signature 3).

It includes clinical and genomic data for 1,134 breast cancer patients, with detailed analysis of mutation frequencies, oncogenic pathway alterations, and differences between Chinese and Western patient populations. The dataset highlights subtype-specific mutation patterns, including enrichment of TP53 and Hippo pathway alterations in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers. It also reveals statistically significant co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity patterns across nine oncogenic pathways. Preliminary preclinical data suggests that NF2 loss-of-function mutations may confer sensitivity to Hippo-targeted therapies. The study contributes to the creation of the Fudan Portal and a precision oncology knowledge base, promoting data sharing and interpretation.

Key findings include the association of BRAF and RBM10 mutations with shorter progression-free survival in metastatic CRC, with RBM10 functioning as a tumor suppressor. Co-mutations such as KRAS/AMER1 and KRAS/APC were enriched in metastatic cases and linked to poor response to bevacizumab. Germline alterations in DNA damage repair genes were observed in 4.6% of patients, frequently accompanied by biallelic loss events. Immune profiling revealed diverse immune microenvironments across genomic subtypes, including MSI-high tumors with immunogenicity and polymerase epsilon-mutated tumors with high mutation burden but low immune activation. This dataset enables deep exploration of the genomic–immune interplay in CRC and supports stratified treatment approaches including immunotherapy.","citation":"Linwei Guo et al.
